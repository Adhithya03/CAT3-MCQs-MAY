Here is the rewritten text with corrected grammar and punctuation:

# CAT3-MCQs-MAY

## Workflow

1. First, I generated questions using GPT-4-Turbo by giving AI prompt shown in the image. I used https://chatkit.app as a frontend for chatting with GPT-4-Turbo, and I have a developer account from https://platform.openai.com, which enables me to access these AI models. (I don't have a ChatGPT Plus subscription; in my opinion, it has very limited model-accessing features, which will be useful for the general public, but I don't prefer it.)

2. Then, I configured .tex files to create questions in a specific format, as shown in https://github.com/Adhithya03/CAT3-MCQs-MAY/blob/main/biomed.tex#L12-L27.

3. Then, the questions from GPT-4-Turbo were given to **GEMINI-1.5-Pro**, which is a free AI model from Google. It formats the questions specifically to create them in the style I want.

Finally, I compiled the .tex file with a LaTeX compiler, for which there are many options available.
